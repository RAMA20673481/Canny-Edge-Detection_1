# WS-3 Image Processing — Exploring Edges and Enhancing Images

WS-3 Image Processing is a simple and interactive project that demonstrates how to analyze and transform images using computer vision techniques.

Welcome to WS-3 Image Processing, a fun and beginner-friendly project created to help you explore the basics of image manipulation! This repository walks you through reading an image, converting it to grayscale, detecting edges, applying blurring, and understanding pixel intensity statistics. Whether you're starting your journey in computer vision or just experimenting with image transformations, this project is a great place to begin!

# Features:

1.Reads and displays an input image

2.Converts the image to grayscale

3.Detects edges using the Canny Edge Detection algorithm

4.Computes minimum, maximum, and median pixel values

5.Applies blur to enhance or smooth the image

6.Visualizes each step clearly using Matplotlib

# Technologies Used:

1.Python

2.OpenCV for image processing

3.NumPy for numerical operations

4.Matplotlib for displaying images

# How to Use:

1.Clone this repository.

2.Add your image (e.g., SEC.jpg) to the project folder.

3.Open and run the notebook or Python script.

4.View each processed output such as grayscale image, blurred image, and edge-detected image.

# Applications:

1.Understanding basic image processing operations

2.Learning how edge detection works

3.Practicing OpenCV and NumPy functions

Preparing for computer vision coursework or labs

Experimenting with filters and image transformations
